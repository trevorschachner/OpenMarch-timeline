/**
 * The Small, Medium and Large front ensemble presets (instruments.md section 6, "Presets"): where
 * each piece of equipment goes and where its player stands, as a pure layout.
 *
 * Units and axes are the 3D world's (`@openmarch/core` `world.ts`): meters, the origin at the 50
 * on the front sideline, +x toward side 2 (right as the audience sees it), +z toward the
 * audience. The design's distances are in feet; {@link FEET} turns them into meters. Presets
 * ignore the venue, and the 5-yard lines are a football field's (15 ft apart from the 50).
 *
 * - The back line (field side) starts 3 ft out: the drum set at center, the xylophone and
 *   glockenspiel either side of it, racks and synths at the outer edges (with two of each, one of
 *   each per side).
 * - The keyboard row starts 3 ft past the back line's deepest item: marimbas in the center, vibes
 *   on each side, the odd one on the left. Neighbors in a row are 2 ft apart.
 * - Speakers stand on the keyboard row's line, one per side on consecutive 5-yard lines, from the
 *   first that is at least 2 ft past the end of the pit.
 * - The podium is on the 50, 3 ft past the keyboard row; the mixer 16 ft to the right, 6 ft past it.
 * - One player per instrument on its playing spot, facing the audience, and a Drum Major on the
 *   podium facing the field.
